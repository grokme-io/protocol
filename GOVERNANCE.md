# Protocol Governance

**TL;DR: There is no governance.**

---

## No Core Team

GROKME Protocol has no:
- ❌ Core developers
- ❌ Foundation
- ❌ Company
- ❌ DAO
- ❌ Multisig
- ❌ Governance tokens

**The protocol is code. The code is complete. The code is immutable.**

---

## Who Builds?

**Anyone. Everyone. No one.**

Like Linux. Like HTTP. Like TCP/IP.

**Contributors are:**
- Independent developers
- Open source enthusiasts  
- Community members
- You (if you want)

**No coordination needed. No permission required.**

---

## Who Decides?

**Mathematics decides.**

Verification criteria are in code:
```solidity
owner == 0x000...dEaD
extractionRate == 0
burnAddress == 0x000...dEaD
```

If code says yes → Verified.
If code says no → Rejected.

**No humans in the loop.**

---

## Official Capsules?

Templates like GROKME ART, GROKME MUSIC are:
- Built by community contributors
- Audited independently
- Released open source
- Renounced at deployment

**"Official" = verified by protocol, not approved by humans.**

---

## How Are Decisions Made?

**There are no decisions to make.**

Protocol is complete. Everything else is optional.

**Want to:**
- Build a capsule? → Build it
- Create a template? → Create it
- Fork the code? → Fork it
- Improve docs? → PR on GitHub

**No votes. No proposals. No gatekeepers.**

## Financial Model

**Revenue:** $0  
**Treasury:** Doesn't exist  
**Token sales:** None  
**Fundraising:** None

**Sustainability model:** Protocol doesn't need money. Code runs for free.

Infrastructure costs are borne by implementations (like GROKME GENESIS), not by protocol.

---

## What About ROADMAP.md?

ROADMAP.md tracks **community contributions**, not corporate plans.

"Q1 2026: GROKME ART" means:
- Contributors are building it
- It will be released open source
- Anyone can use it

**Not a promise. An observation.**

---

## Legal Entity

**There is none.**

Protocol = code on GitHub  
Implementations = independent projects

Like HTTP has no legal entity.  
Like TCP/IP has no legal entity.

**Pure open standard.**

---

## Summary

GROKME Protocol is:
- ✅ Open source (MIT)
- ✅ Decentralized (no central authority)
- ✅ Complete (no ongoing development needed)
- ✅ Autonomous (runs without humans)

Everything beyond the protocol core is optional, independent, and permissionless.

**No governance needed when there's nothing to govern.**

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 2025  
**Status:** Immutable
