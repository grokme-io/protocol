# GROKME Protocol Implementations

Official registry of verified GROKME Protocol implementations.

---

## Protocol Compliance

Any implementation following GROKME Protocol standards can receive **GROKME Certified** status.

**Requirements:**
âœ… Uses GROK Token (0x8390a1DA07e376ef7aDd4Be859BA74Fb83aA02D5)  
âœ… Burns to 0x000...dEaD (100%, zero extraction)  
âœ… Self-sealing mechanism (capacity-based finality)  
âœ… Contract verified (Etherscan)  
âœ… Post-human design (ownership renounced)

**Get certified:** Submit contract to automatic verification at **grokme.io/verify**

**No permission. No approval. Pure automated verification.**

See [`/docs/implementation/CERTIFICATION.md`](docs/implementation/CERTIFICATION.md) for details.

## Registry Structure

All implementations live in `/implementations/` directory:

```
implementations/
â”œâ”€â”€ grokme-me/           (GROKME GENESIS)
â”œâ”€â”€ coming-soon/         (In development)
â””â”€â”€ your-project/        (Submit yours!)
```

Each contains:
- `CAPSULE.md` - Full documentation
- `metadata.json` - Structured data

## Future Capsules

**Status:** More to come  
**Timeline:** TBD

The protocol scales. Anyone can build new capsules following the open standard.
Community-driven expansion.

## Get GROKME Certified

### Automatic Verification

**Step 1: Deploy Your Contract**

Build using protocol templates ([`/contracts/templates/`](contracts/templates/)):
- [ ] Core burn mechanism (100% to 0x000...dEaD)
- [ ] Self-sealing logic (capacity-based)
- [ ] Post-human design (ownership renounced)
- [ ] Contract verified on Etherscan
- [ ] Deployed on Ethereum Mainnet

**Step 2: Submit for Verification**

Visit **grokme.io/verify** and submit your contract address.

Automated crawler will verify:
- âœ… GROK Token address
- âœ… Burn address
- âœ… Owner renounced
- âœ… Capacity limit exists
- âœ… No admin functions
- âœ… Zero extraction

**Step 3: Receive Badge**

If all checks pass:
- âœ… GROKME Certified badge issued
- âœ… Verification page created (grokme.io/certified/{id})
- âœ… Listed on grokme.io implementations registry
- âœ… Badge embeddable on your site

See [`/docs/implementation/CERTIFICATION.md`](docs/implementation/CERTIFICATION.md) for complete details.
