- Five-component scoring (burn, position, special IDs, size, milestones)
- Combination bonuses
- Tier thresholds
- Example calculations
- On-chain vs off-chain storage

### SELF-SEALING-CAPSULE.md

## Current Status

These documents are planned for Phase 2 of documentation.

**For now, see:**
- [WHITEPAPER.md](../../WHITEPAPER.md) for overview
- [MATHEMATICS.md](../../MATHEMATICS.md) for proofs
- [contracts/mainnet/README.md](../../contracts/mainnet/README.md) for implementation details
