**Process:**
1. Submit PR
2. Open discussion (GitHub)
3. Technical review (anyone can review)
4. If consensus reached → Merge
5. If disputed → More discussion

**Merge rights:**
- Repository maintainers (contributors with merge access)
- Consensus required for controversial changes
- Simple fixes merged quickly

### What Gets Merged

- Better docs
- Bug fixes
- Useful tools
- Quality code

❌ **Rejected**

## Communication

**GitHub only:** Issues, Discussions, Pull Requests

No Discord, Telegram, or Twitter. Transparent, asynchronous, permanent, focused.

---

## Consensus Model

### How Decisions Are Made

**No voting. No governance. Community consensus.**

**For documentation:**
- If helpful → Merge
- If disputed → Discuss until consensus

**For code:**
- If correct & useful → Merge
- If risky → Extensive review
- If controversial → Require broad consensus

**For implementations (registry):**
- Verify compliance automatically
- Community reviews manually
- If protocol-compliant → List

**The code itself is the authority.**
