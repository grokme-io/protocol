# GROKME Capsule Registry

**Status:** Coming Q1 2026

---

## What Is This?

A public registry of all verified GROKME capsules.

**Think of it like:**
- DNS registry for domains
- Package registry for npm/pip
- App store for software

**But trustless:** Verification is automatic, not human-approved.

---

## Verification Criteria

Every capsule is checked against:

✅ **Owner = 0x000...dEaD** (renounced)  
✅ **Burn address = 0x000...dEaD** (correct destination)  
✅ **Extraction rate = 0%** (zero fees)

Pass all → Auto-certified  
Fail any → Rejected

**No humans. Pure mathematics.**
