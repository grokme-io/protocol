## Why Memes?

### 1. Homage to GROK's Origin

GROK was born as meme token in 2023.

Genesis preserves meme culture = Full circle.

### 2. Human √ó AI Creative Domain

AI tools like [GROK imagine](https://grok.com/imagine) make creation effortless.

But everything drowns in noise.

Genesis preserves what matters: The brilliance that would otherwise be lost in 48 hours.

### 3. Cultural DNA

Memes are:
- Compressed culture (maximum meaning, minimum data)
- Temporal markers (capture moment in history)
- Human authenticity (AI can't fake the timing)

A meme from 2025 tells future observers more about humanity than 1000 AI-generated images.

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Create

Use any tool you want (including AI like GROK imagine).
Make your meme perfect.

### Step 2: Upload

Visit [grokme.me](https://grokme.me) (or [staging.grokme.me](https://staging.grokme.me) for testing).
Upload your file. Connect wallet.

### Step 3: Choose Burn Rate

Pick between 1-1000 GROK/KB.

Higher burn = Higher rarity.

Formula:
```
Total GROK Burned = ‚åàFile Size KB‚åâ √ó Rate √ó 10‚Åπ
```

### Step 4: Mint

Approve GROK burn ‚Üí Mint NFT.

Your content enters the capsule.

Permanent. Unstoppable. Eternal.

### When Sealed

At 6.9 GB capacity:
- Minting stops forever
- All NFTs remain accessible
- Content becomes eternal museum
- Zero ongoing costs

## Rarity System

Based on **total GROK burned** (not burn rate):

| Tier | Range | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| ‚ö™ COMMON | 0 - 5,000 | Accessible |
| üü¢ UNCOMMON | 5,001 - 25,000 | Entry premium |
| üîµ RARE | 25,001 - 100,000 | Serious commitment |
| üü£ EPIC | 100,001 - 500,000 | Whale territory |
| üü† LEGENDARY | 500,001+ | Ultimate status |

**Additional rarity factors:**
- Special Token IDs (#1, #42, #69, #420, #666, #1337)
- Mint position (early adopters)
- File size (larger preservation)
- Capacity milestones (25%, 50%, 69%, 90%)

All transparent. All on-chain. All verifiable.

## Economics

### Deflation Scenarios

**Conservative** (avg 50 GROK/KB):
- ~337M GROK burned (4.9% of supply)

**Moderate** (avg 100 GROK/KB):
- ~674M GROK burned (9.8% of supply)

**Aggressive** (avg 200 GROK/KB):
- ~1.35B GROK burned (19.5% of supply)

**Optimistic** (avg 300 GROK/KB):
- ~2.02B GROK burned (29.3% of supply)

**Genesis alone: Up to 30% of GROK supply permanently destroyed.**

### Zero Extraction

100% of burned GROK goes to: `0x000...dEaD`

No team. No treasury. No fees.
