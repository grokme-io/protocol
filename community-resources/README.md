‚ùå **Official marketing** - No company exists  
‚ùå **Investment advice** - Educational purpose only

## Language Guidelines

### Use Protocol-Appropriate Language

**‚úÖ Good:**
- "Information sharing"
- "Educational resources"
- "Community contributions"
- "Technical documentation"

**‚ùå Avoid:**
- "Marketing materials"
- "Promotional content"
- "Campaign assets"
- "Sales pitch"

### Why This Matters

GROKME has:
- No team (nobody to "market")
- No revenue (0% extraction)
- No commercial interest (pure utility)
- No governance (autonomous code)

Using commercial language contradicts the nature of the protocol.

1. **State facts** - No speculation
2. **Provide sources** - Always link
