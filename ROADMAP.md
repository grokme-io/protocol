# Protocol Evolution

**Important:** This is NOT a development roadmap. The protocol is complete and autonomous.

This document tracks **community contributions** and **upcoming capsule templates** being prepared by independent builders.

No core team. No commercial entity. Pure open source.

### ðŸ”œ Verification Dashboard

**Live contract verification at:** `grokme.io/verify`

Enter any contract address â†’ Instant verification.

**Checks:**
- Owner = 0x000...dEaD?
- Burn address = 0x000...dEaD?
- Extraction rate = 0%?

Pass all â†’ Auto-certified. Fail any â†’ Rejected.

### ðŸ”œ Public Registry

**Central registry at:** `grokme.io/registry`

All verified capsules listed:
- Official templates (GENESIS, UNIVERSAL, ART, etc.)
- Community implementations (anyone can build)
- Live stats (capacity, burns, status)

## Q2 2026+

### ðŸ”® Community Templates

Independent builders creating specialized capsules:

**Examples (not official, community-driven):**
- GROKME SCIENCE (research papers, data)
- GROKME CODE (open source projects)
- GROKME FASHION (design archives)
- GROKME FILM (independent cinema)
- GROKME COMICS (webcomics, graphic novels)

**Anyone can build. Anyone can verify. Anyone can use.**

### ðŸ”® Advanced Features (Community-Driven)

Possible additions by independent contributors:
- Multi-capsule indexing
- Cross-capsule search
- Enhanced rarity systems
- Additional metadata standards

**Note:** Protocol core remains immutable. Extensions are optional.

## The Vision

**Like TLDs for domains:**
Every project picks the capsule that fits their culture.

**Like HTTP for websites:**
Universal standard, infinite implementations.

**Like Linux for operating systems:**
Open, decentralized, community-driven.

## No Roadmap Promises

This is NOT a corporate roadmap.

**What this document shows:**
- Templates being prepared by community
- Features contributors are building
- Direction of ecosystem growth

**What this document does NOT guarantee:**
- Specific dates (no one controls timeline)
- Specific features (community decides)
- Centralized development (no core team)

**The protocol is complete. Everything else is optional.**
