# Protocol Evolution

**Important:** This is NOT a development roadmap. The protocol is complete and autonomous.

This document tracks **community contributions** and **upcoming capsule templates** being prepared by independent builders.

No core team. No commercial entity. Pure open source.

---

## Q4 2025 — COMPLETED

### ✅ Protocol Launch
- Smart contract templates released
- Mathematical proofs published
- Infrastructure guides available
- Protocol specification finalized

### ✅ GROK NFT — LIVE
- First implementation (grokme.me) — **live on Ethereum Mainnet since November 2025**
- 690 NFTs per capsule (self-sealing)
- 6 rarity tiers (Common → Unicorn)
- **305M+ GROK burned** through utility
- Decentralized infrastructure: IPFS Cluster + Akash Network + Cloudflare
- Status: Autonomous, operational, filling

---

## Q1 2026 — IN PROGRESS

### � GROKME ARENA — The Utility Expansion

On-chain meme battle protocol. The biggest GROK utility expansion since launch.

- **Smart contracts complete:** GrokmeArena (73 tests) + GrokmeArenaTrophy (27 tests) = 100/100 passing
- **Mechanic:** Any ERC-20 holder challenges any rival community. Real stakes. Poker-style bidding. Provably fair on-chain voting.
- **Burns:** 5% protocol fee on every stake → auto-swapped to GROK via Uniswap → burned. Every battle burns GROK regardless of which tokens fight.
- **Settlement:** Permissionless. Winner meme → eternal Trophy NFT. Loser meme → destroyed. All tokens → 0x...dEaD.
- **Security:** Renounced design. No admin. No upgrade. No kill switch. Vote manipulation mathematically impossible.
- **Status:** Frontend + API + DB complete. Deployment and launch imminent.

### 🔴 [REDACTED] — Major New Capsule

A significant new implementation of the GROKME Protocol. Details under wraps.

- Extends the protocol far beyond meme culture
- Expected to drive **massive GROK burn volume**
- Large-scale investment in development, infrastructure, and physical products
- Burns GROK via the same protocol mechanics (100% to 0x...dEaD)
- Announcement coming soon

**This is not incremental. This is a new dimension for the protocol and GROK utility.**

### 🔜 Capsule Templates

Pre-built, audited capsule contracts for different content domains:
- **GROKME UNIVERSAL** (all content) — Planned
- **GROKME ART** (visual art) — Planned
- **GROKME MUSIC** (audio) — Planned

All capsules: 100% GROK burn, owner renounced, zero extraction, free to use globally.

## Q2 2026+

### Arena Expansion
- Top 20 Ethereum meme communities onboarded
- Open Challenge Board live
- Community profiles & rankings (Legends Hall)
- Fan Staking feature

### Multi-Chain
- Base Chain deployment for low-gas Arena voting
- Cross-chain considerations

### 🔮 Community Templates

Independent builders creating specialized capsules:
- GROKME SCIENCE (research papers, data)
- GROKME CODE (open source projects)
- GROKME FASHION (design archives)
- GROKME FILM (independent cinema)

**Anyone can build. Anyone can verify. Anyone can use.**

### Q4 2026: Open-Source Battle Contract SDK
- Any community can deploy their own Arena instance
- Every instance burns GROK via the 5% protocol fee
- GROKME becomes a protocol standard, not just a product

**Note:** Protocol core remains immutable. Extensions are optional.

---

## The Vision

**Like TLDs for domains:**
Every project picks the capsule that fits their culture.

**Like HTTP for websites:**
Universal standard, infinite implementations.

**Like Linux for operating systems:**
Open, decentralized, community-driven.

## No Roadmap Promises

This is NOT a corporate roadmap.

**What this document shows:**
- Templates being prepared by community
- Features contributors are building
- Direction of ecosystem growth

**What this document does NOT guarantee:**
- Specific dates (no one controls timeline)
- Specific features (community decides)
- Centralized development (no core team)

**The protocol is complete. Everything else is optional.**
